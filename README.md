## Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SEBASBELMOS/workshop-003.git
   cd workshop-001
   ````

2. **Installing the dependencies with _Poetry_**
    - Windows: 
        - In Powershell, execute this command: 
            ```powershell
            (Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://install.python-poetry.org -UseBasicParsing).Content | py -
            ```
            <img src="https://github.com/SEBASBELMOS/workshop-003/blob/main/assets/poetry_installation.png" width="600"/>
        - Press Win + R, type _sysdm.cpl_, and press **Enter**. 
        - Go to the _Advanced_ tab, select _environment variable_.
        - Under System variables, select Path â†’ Click Edit.
        - Click _Edit_ and set the path provided during the installation in **PATH** so that the `poetry` command works. ("C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\Python\Scripts")
        - Restart Powershell and execute _poetry --version_.

        
    - Linux
        - In a terminal, execute this command:
            ```bash
            curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
            ```
            <img src="https://github.com/SEBASBELMOS/workshop-003/blob/main/assets/poetry_linux.png" width="600"/>
        -  Now, execute:
            ```bash
            export PATH = "/home/user/.locar/bin:$PATH"
            ```
        -Finally, restart the terminal and execute _poetry --version_.

3. **Poetry Shell**
    - Enter the Poetry shell with _poetry shell_.
    - Then, execute _poetry init_, it will create a file called _pyproject.toml_
    - To add all the dependencies, execute this: 
        ```bash
        poetry add pandas matplotlib psycopg2-binary sqlalchemy python-dotenv seaborn ipykernel dotenv
        ```
    - Install the dependencies with: 
        ```bash
        poetry install
        ```
        In case of error with the .lock file, just execute _poetry lock_ to fix it.
    - Create the kernel with this command (You must choose this kernel when running the notebooks):
        ```bash
        poetry run python -m ipykernel install --user --name workshop-003 --display-name "Python (workshop-003)"
        ```

4. **Enviromental variables**
    >Realise this in VS Code.

    1. Inside the cloned repository, create a new directory named *env/*.
    2. Within that directory, create a file called *.env*.
    3. In the *.env file*, define the following six environment variables (without double quotes around values):
        ```python
        PG_HOST = #host address, e.g. localhost or 127.0.0.1
        PG_PORT = #PostgreSQL port, e.g. 5432

        PG_USER = #your PostgreSQL user
        PG_PASSWORD = #your user password
        
        PG_DATABASE = #your database name, e.g. postgres
        ```
